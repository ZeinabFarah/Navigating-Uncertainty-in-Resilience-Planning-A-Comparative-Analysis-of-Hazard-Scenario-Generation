### Navigating Uncertainty in Resilience Planning: A Comparative Analysis of Hazard Scenario Generation

This repository comprises two distinct folders: **"Codes"** and **"Manuscript"**:

#### Codes  
This folder includes three subfolders: 

1. *Methods*  
This folder contains code that displays the optimal importance distribution for various combinations of loss function and probability distribution, which are commonly encountered in the assessment of community resilience against natural hazards.

2. *Illustrative Example*  
This folder contains code that illustrates the efficiency of crude Monte Carlo and Importance Sampling as methods for generating hazard scenarios, using an illusterative hypothetical example.   

3. *Hazard Scenario Generation*  
This directory includes code that demonstrates the significance of selecting the appropriate hazard scenario. It analyzes the results of both crude Monte Carlo and Importance Sampling methods, shedding light on their implications for the decision-making process.
 
#### Manuscript
This folder contains the Overleaf manuscript detailing the Monte Carlo simulation and the importance sampling method to propagate uncertainty in community resilience models. 

#### Getting Started
To use the code, clone the repository and navigate to the desired folder.
