\section{Introduction}
    In recent years, the world has seen a worrying increase in the number and severity of natural disasters. In 2022, the destructive Hurricane Ian caused an unprecedented \$112.9 billion in damages, and the relentless Western and Central Drought/Heat Wave, resulted in \$22.1 billion in economic losses \cite{noaa_billion-dollar_2023}. The year 2023 has brought an even more troubling realityâ€”a record-breaking 23 confirmed weather and climate disaster events, each with losses exceeding \$1 billion \cite{noaa_assessing_2023}.
    
    In the face of such daunting challenges, the urgent need to make communities more resilient has become more crucial than ever. A critical aspect of this effort is the accurate representation of hazard scenarios, which serves as the foundation for informed decision-making aimed at safeguarding lives, infrastructure, and the environment. The necessity to accurately depict hazard scenarios for informed decision-making is not just a theoretical concern anymore; it's an urgent and practical requirement. 
    
    Considering this background, this paper investigates hazard scenario generation, focusing on two fundamental simulation methods: Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and Importance Sampling (IS).
    Our primary objective is twofold. First, we illustrate the performance of the MC and IS techniques as hazard scenario generation approaches in a clear and understandable manner. Second, we'll focus on the important role of creating scenarios when planning for resilience. Creating scenarios can exert a significant influence on the decision-making process in the context of community resilience. We assert that an inadequate or inaccurate representation of hazard scenarios can lead to suboptimal decisions, thus jeopardizing the efficacy of resilience efforts.
    
    To begin, we establish a baseline by defining a pre-mitigation hypothetical loss function, offering a basis for evaluating resilience. Subsequently, we introduce three distinct resilience actions, each yielding a unique loss function representing post-mitigation conditions. Through the generation of various hazard scenarios, we illuminate the nuanced distinctions that these methods introduce, shedding light on their implications for community resilience.
    
    The paper's subsequent sections are organized as follows: Section 2 offers a brief background and reviews relevant literature concerning the application of MC and IS methods in addressing uncertainty within risk and resilience assessment. Section 3 provides a comprehensive explanation of importance sampling techniques, including their mathematical representations, and introduces the specialized adaptive importance sampling method known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (MCMC-IS). Section 4 conducts a comparative analysis between MC and IS, utilizing a one-dimensional numerical example for comparison purposes. Section 5 underscores the significance of precise hazard scenario generation, while our concluding remarks are presented in Section 6.
